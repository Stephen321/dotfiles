## Issues

- basedpyright/ruff clashes and not setup right in the first place...or cant
  disable some warnings
  - Can't disable basedpyright diagnostics...don't think it's worrking
    correctly. Need to set it in pyproject.toml
  - Should use ruff as lsp?
  - Don't think ruff is being used for linting/static analysis. Disabling
    rules in pyproject.toml doesn't change anything. Maybe need to set
    in it's venv?...
